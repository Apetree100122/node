## Quickstart <a id="chapter-888ccd"></a>
* Follow the steps below

### Run a single Node (development)
* [Example "dev" development PoS testnet (with single node)
](./EXAMPLES.md#example-dev-development-pos-testnet-with-single-node-)

### Run multiple Nodes (local testnet)
* [Example "local" PoS testnet (with multiple nodes)](./EXAMPLES.md#example-local-pos-testnet-with-multiple-nodes-)

### Run multiple Nodes (latest_testnet)
* [Testnet (Alpha) "testnet_latest" PoS testnet (with multiple nodes)](./EXAMPLES.md#testnet-alpha-testnet_latest-pos-testnet-with-multiple-nodes-)

### Run a Validator node (Harbour testnet)
* [Setup Validator Node](https://dev.datahighway.com/docs/en/tutorials/tutorials-nodes-validator-setup)

### Run a Collator node as a parachain to Polkadot (Chachacha/Rococo)
